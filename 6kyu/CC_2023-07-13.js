/* The Supermarket Queue

There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

Input:
- customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
- n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.

Output:
The function should return an integer, the total time required.

Examples:
queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// should return 12
// because when there is 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times

queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
// should return 10
// because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the 
// queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
// should return 12

Clarifications:
There is only ONE queue serving many tills, and
The order of the queue NEVER changes, and
The front person in the queue (i.e. the first element in the array/list) proceeds to a till as soon as it becomes free.
N.B. You should assume that all the test input will be valid, as specified above.

function queueTime(customers, n) {
  let tills = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
  customers.forEach(el => {
    let nextTill = tills.indexOf(Math.min(...tills));
    tills[nextTill] += el;
  })
    
  return Math.max(...tills);
}
